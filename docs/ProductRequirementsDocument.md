The key aspects of the screen are:
* Header: a fixed header that displays the current month that entries are being provided for
* Calendar: a calendar view with a row for each week
* Totals: for each day, optionally an entry showing how many hours were worked in the office and another entry showing how many were worked at home
* Navigation bar: 

An initial mockup for the main page is shown in HomeScreen.png.

## Header

The header is to display the name of the month that corresponds to the majority of dates in the first row of the calendar view.

## Calendar View

The calendar view:
* shows a row for week
* each week shall show the days from Sunday to Saturday
* for each day there can be a value for the number of hours worked at home and an entry for the number worked in the office
* the calendar weeks are to scroll vertically to allow the user to move forwards and backwards through dates
* if a date is selected, an entry screen is to be displayed that prompts the user to enter the number of hours worked at home and in the office for that day.

## Totals

The totals are to be shown in cards at the bottom of the page.

There should be two cards:

* Monthly Card, containing Total hours worked at home and office for the month
* Yearly Card, containing Total hours worked at home and office for the financial year that the month falls into. Financial years
run from 1st July to the 30th June.
